    <div>It has been said that writing brings form to chaos.</div>
    <div>Good writing is a step on the path of establishing a crediable story or narrative.
        And theese days it seems there is an ever-growing emphasis on concisness or concisity.

    <h5>Tweestmasters is a place where writers can improve their skills in a collaborative
        and fun environment.</h5>

    <h1 class="pt-4">Getting Around:</h1>
    <article>
        <p> At the heart of Tweestmasters is the tweest. Tweests are tweested by users and
            reviewed by other users. Reviews contain a rating and a comment.
        </p>
        <p>Tweestmasters uses forums to organize itself and is comprised of the main
            forum(Master) and other user-created forums. Each forum has a leader and the
            leader creates articles for the forum.
        </p>

        <p> Any user can start a group(public or private) and get friends and family and
            other users to participate in it. Public groups should perhaps have a theme
            (sports, fashion, nature, etc) making it easier for their group to be
            classified and thus found.</p>

        <p>Forum articles are nothing but guidance or inspiration for the tweests and the
            tweest is the product of your imagination. It can be fiction or autobiographical.
            The sole purpose is to entertain and to get better at writing by composing a short
            story based on the inspiration. Tweests can be 'reviewed' by other members. The 'review'
            consists of a rating and a comment feedback(hopefully helpful, witty, funny, etc).
        </p>
        <p>The home page contains a feature article that changes on occasion. This article
            is from the Master forum. You can tweest this article or look through past articles
            and user tweests/reviews. You can also change to other forums from the home page.</p>
