        <p> At the heart of Tweestmasters is the tweest.
        </p>
        <p>Tweests are tweested by users and
            reviewed by other users. Reviews contain a rating and a comment.
        </p>
        <p>Tweestmasters uses forums to organize itself and is comprised of the main
            forum(called 'Master') and other user-created forums. Each forum has a leader
            and the leader creates articles for the forum. Forums can be public or private.
        </p>
        <p> Any user can start a forum and get friends and family and
            other users to participate in it. Public groups should perhaps have a theme
            (sports, fashion, nature, etc) making it easier for their group to be
            classified and thus found.
        </p>
        <p>Forum articles are nothing but guidance or inspiration for the tweests and a
            tweest is the product of your imagination. It can be fiction or autobiographical or whatever.
            The sole purpose is to entertain and to get better at writing by composing a short
            story based on the inspiration. Tweests can be 'reviewed' by other members. The 'review'
            consists of a rating and a comment feedback(hopefully helpful, witty, funny, etc).
        </p>
        <p>The home page contains a feature article that changes on occasion. This article
            is from the Master forum. You can tweest this article or look through past articles
            and user tweests/reviews. You can also change to other forums from the home page.</p>

        250 and 10,000 characters.
